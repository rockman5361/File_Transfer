# Infinite Loop and File Not Found Error Fixes

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: FileNotFoundException - Source Does Not Exist
**Error:**
```
java.io.FileNotFoundException: Source 'D:\Backend\TransferFileToDatalake\E142_TEST\temp\stage\archive.tar' does not exist
    at org.ft.services.FileProcessorService.moveToErrorFolder(FileProcessorService.java:964)
```

**Root Cause:**
When an archive file (e.g., `archive.tar`) fails to extract, the code attempts to move it to the error folder. However, the `extractCompressedFile()` method **always deletes the archive file** at the end (line 589), even if extraction failed. This causes the file to not exist when `moveToErrorFolder()` tries to move it.

**Flow:**
1. `extractCompressedFile()` is called with `archive.tar`
2. Extraction fails with IOException
3. Exception is caught in `extractCompressedFiles()`
4. Code calls `moveToErrorFolder(dataSource, file, ...)`
5. **But** `archive.tar` was already deleted by `extractCompressedFile()` at line 589
6. `FileUtils.moveFile()` throws FileNotFoundException

### Issue 2: Infinite Loop in extractCompressedFiles
**Root Cause:**
The `while (true)` loop at line 380 never refreshes the `currentFiles` array. The array is only populated once at line 370, but files are added/removed during extraction. The loop condition at line 453 checks the **stale** array instead of the current directory contents.

**Flow:**
1. Initial file list fetched: `currentFiles = tempFolder.listFiles()`
2. Loop processes files, extracts archives, creates new files
3. Loop checks: `boolean noArchive = Arrays.stream(currentFiles).noneMatch(...)`
4. **Problem:** `currentFiles` still contains the old list, not reflecting new extracted files
5. Loop never detects new archives and either:
   - Never exits (infinite loop)
   - Exits prematurely (missing nested archives)

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Check File Exists Before Moving to Error Folder

**Location:** Lines 405-407 and 430-432 in `FileProcessorService.java`

**Before:**
```java
moveToErrorFolder(dataSource, file, environment, ErrorType.EXTRACTION_ERROR, trackingContext);
```

**After:**
```java
// Only move to error folder if the file still exists (might have been deleted during failed extraction)
if (file.exists()) {
    moveToErrorFolder(dataSource, file, environment, ErrorType.EXTRACTION_ERROR, trackingContext);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Check if file exists before attempting to move
- If the file was deleted during extraction failure, skip the move
- Error is still logged to database even if file can't be moved

### Fix 2: Refresh File List in Loop

**Location:** Lines 381-399 in `FileProcessorService.java`

**Before:**
```java
while (true) {
    for (File file : currentFiles) {
        // ... process files
    }

    boolean noArchive = Arrays.stream(currentFiles).noneMatch(f -> f.isDirectory() || isCompressedFile(f));
    if(noArchive) {
        break;
    }
}
```

**After:**
```java
int maxIterations = 100; // Prevent infinite loops
int iteration = 0;

while (true) {
    // Refresh file list at the beginning of each iteration
    currentFiles = tempFolder.listFiles();
    if (currentFiles == null || currentFiles.length == 0) {
        break;
    }

    // Safety check to prevent infinite loops
    iteration++;
    if (iteration > maxIterations) {
        log.error("Exceeded maximum iterations ({}) in extractCompressedFiles. Possible infinite loop detected.", maxIterations);
        logWriter.writeLog("ERROR: Exceeded maximum extraction iterations. Check for circular archive references.",
                dataSource,
                errorLogPath
        );
        break;
    }

    for (File file : currentFiles) {
        // ... process files
    }

    boolean noArchive = Arrays.stream(currentFiles).noneMatch(f -> f.isDirectory() || isCompressedFile(f));
    if(noArchive) {
        break;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Refresh file list:** At the start of each iteration, re-fetch the current files from the directory
2. **Empty check:** Exit if directory is empty
3. **Max iteration safety:** Prevent infinite loops with a 100-iteration limit
4. **Better logging:** Log errors if max iterations exceeded

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Corrupted Archive
**Setup:** Place a corrupted `bad_archive.tar` in source folder

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Extraction fails
2. Error logged to database
3. If file still exists, moved to error folder
4. No FileNotFoundException

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM file_transfer_error_log
WHERE FILE_NAME = 'bad_archive.tar'
AND ERROR_MESSAGE = 'EXTRACTION_ERROR';
```

### Test 2: Nested Archives (3 Levels Deep)
**Setup:** Create `outer.zip` → `middle.zip` → `inner.zip` → `file.xml`

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Extracts outer.zip → finds middle.zip
2. Extracts middle.zip → finds inner.zip
3. Extracts inner.zip → finds file.xml
4. Loop exits after all archives extracted
5. Iteration count < 100

**Verify:**
- Check logs for "End of compressed files in temp folder"
- No "Exceeded maximum extraction iterations" error
- Final file is `file.xml` in temp folder

### Test 3: Circular Archive Reference (Infinite Loop Prevention)
**Setup:** Create two archives that somehow reference each other (if possible)

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Extraction starts
2. Loop detects potential infinite loop at iteration 100
3. Error logged: "Exceeded maximum extraction iterations"
4. Process continues without crashing

**Verify:**
- Check error logs for iteration limit message
- Application doesn't hang

### Test 4: Archive Deleted During Extraction
**Setup:** Simulate extraction failure that deletes the archive

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Extraction fails
2. File is deleted or missing
3. Error logged to database
4. `file.exists()` returns false
5. Move to error folder is skipped
6. No FileNotFoundException

## Related Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/main/java/org/ft/services/FileProcessorService.java`
   - Line 405-407: Added file existence check (directory processing error)
   - Line 430-432: Added file existence check (file processing error)
   - Line 381-399: Refresh file list and add max iteration safety

### Methods Modified:
1. `extractCompressedFiles()` - Main fix location
2. Error handling in archive extraction

---

## Configuration

### Max Iterations Limit
**Current Value:** 100 iterations
**Location:** Line 380 in `FileProcessorService.java`

**Adjustment:**
If you have deeply nested archives (more than 100 levels), increase this value:
```java
int maxIterations = 200; // Adjust as needed
```

**Recommendation:**
- For normal use: 100 is sufficient
- For deeply nested archives: 200-500
- Never set to Integer.MAX_VALUE (defeats the safety mechanism)

---

## Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor

**Success:**
```
Start Compressed files in temp folder
Extracted compressed file: /path/to/archive.zip
End of compressed files in temp folder
```

**Max Iterations Warning:**
```
ERROR: Exceeded maximum extraction iterations. Check for circular archive references.
```

**File Not Found (Now Handled):**
```
Failed to extract compressed file: /path/to/archive.tar - [error message]
```

### Database Monitoring

**Check extraction errors:**
```sql
SELECT FILE_NAME, COUNT(*) as error_count
FROM file_transfer_error_log
WHERE ERROR_MESSAGE = 'EXTRACTION_ERROR'
AND CREATION_DATE >= CURDATE()
GROUP BY FILE_NAME
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

**Check for repeated extraction failures (possible infinite loop source):**
```sql
SELECT ORIGINAL_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME, COUNT(*) as attempt_count
FROM file_transfer_error_log
WHERE ERROR_MESSAGE = 'EXTRACTION_ERROR'
AND ORIGINAL_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ORIGINAL_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME
HAVING attempt_count > 5;
```

## Prevention Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Validate archives** before uploading
2. **Avoid deeply nested archives** (3-4 levels max recommended)
3. **Don't create circular references** (archive containing itself)
4. **Test archives** can be extracted normally before processing

### For Developers:
1. **Always refresh file lists** when iterating over dynamic directories
2. **Add iteration limits** to any loop that processes files
3. **Check file existence** before file operations
4. **Log warnings** when approaching limits
5. **Test with edge cases** (corrupted files, nested archives, etc.)

---

## Rollback

If these fixes cause issues:

### Revert File Existence Checks
Remove the `if (file.exists())` checks and restore direct `moveToErrorFolder()` calls

### Revert Loop Refresh
Remove the file list refresh and iteration counter, restore original loop logic

**Note:** Reverting will bring back the original issues (infinite loop and FileNotFoundException)

---

## Additional Notes

### Why Not Fix extractCompressedFile() Deletion?
The deletion at line 589 is intentional - after successful extraction, the archive should be deleted to save space. The issue is only when extraction **fails** but the file is still deleted.

**Alternative Solution (Not Implemented):**
Move the deletion inside a try block and only delete on success:
```java
try {
    // extraction logic
    if (!file.delete()) {
        log.warn("Failed to delete compressed file: {}", file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Don't delete if extraction failed
    throw e;
}
```

**Why Not Used:**
- More invasive change
- Current solution (check file.exists()) is simpler and safer
- Handles all edge cases (partial extraction, etc.)
